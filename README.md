🧓 Age & Stroke:
• Stroke risk rises sharply with age. Most stroke cases occur in people above 50 years old.
• Older individuals also tend to have higher glucose levels, BMI, hypertension, and heart disease.

⚧ Gender:
• Males generally show slightly higher rates of heart disease and stroke compared to females.
• Females dominate the dataset overall, but male health risks increase earlier with age.

💓 Hypertension & Heart Disease:
• Both conditions strongly correlate with stroke occurrence.
• People with hypertension are far more likely to have heart disease or stroke.
• The combination of heart disease and hypertension dramatically increases stroke probability.

💍 Ever Married:
• Most married individuals fall into older age brackets, explaining higher rates of stroke and heart disease.
• Unmarried people, being younger on average, show fewer health complications.

💼 Work Type:
• The majority work in private jobs, followed by self-employed and government workers.
• 'Children' and 'Never_worked' categories belong to younger groups with very low stroke incidence.
• Lifestyle and work stress factors may influence BMI and glucose variation across work types.

🏠 Residence Type:
• The dataset is evenly split between Urban and Rural populations.
• Urban residents show slightly higher average glucose and BMI values — possibly due to dietary habits.
• Stroke distribution is nearly equal across both residence types.

🩸 Average Glucose Level & BMI:
• Both are key numeric indicators strongly tied to stroke and heart disease.
• High glucose and high BMI combinations appear frequently in stroke cases.
• Glucose level tends to increase with age, while BMI varies more by lifestyle and work type.

🚬 Smoking Status:
• 'Never smoked' is the largest group, followed by 'formerly smoked' and 'smokes'.
• Smokers and former smokers display slightly higher glucose and BMI levels, linking to greater stroke risk.
• 'Unknown' entries may represent missing or unrecorded lifestyle data.

⚠️ Stroke & Stroke Flag:
• Only about 5% of the population experienced a stroke — indicating class imbalance.
• Stroke cases cluster among older, hypertensive, heart-disease, and high-glucose individuals.
• Stroke_flag = 1 represents stroke cases, while 0 indicates healthy individuals.

🧠 Overall Insight:
• Age, hypertension, heart disease, and glucose are the strongest stroke predictors.
• Gender, marriage, work type, residence, BMI, and smoking add contextual lifestyle impact.
• The dataset clearly shows how aging and chronic conditions interact to raise stroke risk.
